# matplotlib-challenge
## Task:
Using a number of libraries such as MatPlotLib, Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy.Stats within Jupyter Notebook, search through the data to calculate and/or visualize the following things:
-------------------------------
-The number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study
*<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualized in a bar graph generated with both Pandas and PyPlot*
<br/><br/>-The distribution of female or male mice in the study
  *<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualized in a pie chart generated with both Pandas and PyPlot*
<br/><br/>-The final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin along with the quartiles and IQR for each drug, then use these numbers to quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers.
  *<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualized in box and whisker plots generated with PyPlot*
<br/><br/>-The tumor volume of a specific mouse treated with Capomulin across each timepoint of the study
  *<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualized in a line graph generated with PyPlot*
<br/><br/>-The average tumor volume of mice treated with Capomulin against their weight along with the regression model and correlation coefficient
  *<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualized in a scatter plot generated with PyPlot*
